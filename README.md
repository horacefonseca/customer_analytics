## Overview

This project analyzes canteen shop transactional data to identify customer segments and provide data-driven business recommendations. By combining rule-based RFM segmentation with machine learning clustering (KMeans), the analysis validates customer groupings and enables targeted marketing strategies.

**Dataset**: Canteen shop transaction records including customer IDs, purchase dates, items, quantities, and prices.

**Goal**: Deliver three core actionable insights:
1. High-value customer profile and retention strategy
2. Churn risk quantification and win-back priority
3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) analysis and Pareto principle validation

## Three Core Insights

### 1. High-Value Customer Profile and Retention Strategy

**Key Segments**: Champions (RFM) and VIP Champions (KMeans Cluster)

**Characteristics**:
- Lowest recency (most recent purchases)
- Highest frequency (most purchases)
- Highest monetary value (largest spend)
- Most stable and profitable revenue stream

**Recommended Action**: **Retention & Loyalty Focus**
- Provide VIP treatment and exclusive offers
- Implement loyalty rewards programs
- Prevent churn through personalized engagement

**Expected Outcome**: Maintain 95%+ retention rate, increase lifetime value by 15-20%

---

### 2. Churn Risk Quantification and Win-Back Priority

**Key Segments**: At Risk (RFM) and Low Engagement (KMeans Cluster)

**Characteristics**:
- High recency (long time since last purchase)
- Historically high frequency/monetary value
- Valuable customers on verge of becoming "Lost"

**Recommended Action**: **Implement Win-Back Campaigns**
- Launch targeted email campaigns with special discounts
- Send personalized "We miss you" messages
- Survey to understand disengagement reasons
- Create urgency with limited-time offers

**Expected Outcome**: Recover 30-40% of at-risk customers, generate significant recovered revenue

---

### 3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and Pareto Principle

**Key Metrics**:
- **Total CLTV**: Quantifies total customer base worth
- **Average CLTV**: Sets acquisition cost targets
- **Pareto Distribution**: Validates revenue concentration

**Findings**:
- Top 20% of customers typically account for 70-80% of total CLTV
- Clear justification for prioritizing high-value segments
- Data-driven budget allocation for marketing spend

**Recommended Action**: **Strategic Resource Allocation**
- Set maximum CAC at 30% of average CLTV
- Allocate 50% of budget to Champion/VIP retention
- Prioritize top-tier customers identified by both RFM and KMeans

**Expected Outcome**: Optimized marketing ROI, improved customer acquisition efficiency

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Remove transactions with negative quantities (returns)
- Filter out zero or negative prices
- Calculate total transaction value (Quantity √ó Price)
- Handle missing customer IDs

### 2. RFM Analysis

**Recency**: Days since last purchase (lower is better)
```python
Recency = Snapshot_Date - Last_Purchase_Date
```

**Frequency**: Number of transactions (higher is better)
```python
Frequency = Count of unique transactions per customer
```

**Monetary**: Total spend (higher is better)
```python
Monetary = Sum of all transaction values per customer
```

**Scoring**: Each metric scored 1-5 (or 1-3 for Monetary based on distribution)
- Combined RFM score determines segment classification
- 8 predefined segments: Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, Recent Customers, At Risk, Can't Lose Them, Lost, Others

### 3. CLTV Calculation

```python
CLTV = Average_Order_Value √ó Purchase_Frequency √ó Customer_Lifespan_Years
```

**Components**:
- `Average_Order_Value = Total_Revenue / Num_Purchases`
- `Purchase_Frequency = (Num_Purchases / Customer_Lifespan_Days) √ó 365`
- `Customer_Lifespan_Years = (Last_Date - First_Date + 1) / 365`

### 4. KMeans Clustering

**Feature Preparation**:
- Log transformation of Monetary values (handle skewness)
- StandardScaler normalization (mean=0, std=1)

**Optimal K Selection**:
- Elbow method: Plot inertia for K=2 to K=10
- Identified optimal K=4 based on elbow curve

**Cluster Naming**:
- VIP Champions: High Frequency + High Monetary
- Recent Big Spenders: Low Recency + High Monetary
- Low Engagement: Low Frequency + Low Monetary
- Regular Customers: Moderate across metrics

### 5. Validation

**Convergence Analysis**:
- Cross-tabulation of RFM segments vs KMeans clusters
- High alignment confirms robust segmentation
- Both methods identify similar high-value and at-risk groups
