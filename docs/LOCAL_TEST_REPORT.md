## Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Unicode Characters in Console
**Problem**: Windows console (cp1252) doesn't support Unicode checkmarks
**Impact**: Test script print statements
**Resolution**: Replaced with ASCII characters `[OK]` and `[ERROR]`
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue 2: Streamlit Email Prompt
**Problem**: First-time Streamlit run asks for email
**Impact**: Blocks automated testing
**Resolution**: Created `.streamlit/config.toml` with `headless=true`
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue 3: Git Commit Attribution
**Problem**: Co-Authored-By line in commit messages
**Impact**: User preference for authorship
**Resolution**: Used `git filter-branch` to remove Co-Authored-By lines
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. ✅ App loads without errors
2. ✅ All 6 sections accessible (Executive Summary, RFM, CLTV, KMeans, Comparative, Recommendations)
3. ✅ Visualizations render correctly
4. ✅ Metrics display proper values
5. ✅ Navigation works smoothly
6. ✅ Data loads from CSV successfully

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### If App Fails to Start:
1. Check Streamlit Cloud logs
2. Verify all dependencies installed
3. Ensure data file path is correct: `data/canteen_shop_data.csv`

### If Visualizations Don't Show:
1. Check matplotlib/seaborn versions
2. Verify data processing completed successfully
3. Review browser console for errors

### If Performance is Slow:
1. Enable caching (already implemented with `@st.cache_data`)
2. Consider data downsampling for larger datasets
3. Optimize visualization rendering
